# Overview

This is my first mobile app, made with a focus for Android but should still support iOS.

The app is a scripture journal. Create your own entries in the journal with a title and a book/verse and page number, with room for your notes and thoughts. The entries are saved to disk.

I created this app because mobile development is more important than ever before and occupies a large portion of the software development industry. Additionally, phones are almost always on our persons and being able to make a personal tool that's always available is a priceless skill.
